# Intel-Products-Sentiment-Analysis

Hello, 

In this analysis, the user sentiments on Intel processors, mobile and desktop of 12th, 13th and 14th generations were analysed through the processors' online reviews. The aim of this analysis was to make a sentiment analysis model from online reviews, by using two different approaches, a rule-based tool and a machine learning model. 

To try the model follow these steps:

To note:
  The dataset has been sourced from Amazon, using an API tool from Apify.com.
  The dataset has been categorised by the three Intel processor generations: 12th, 13th and 14th.
  So, ensure to download the right dataset, to perform the analysis.
  
1. Download the datasets:
     Download any of the csv files, for example, the "Intel 12th gen data.csv" file.
     This dataset will be uploaded to our Google Colab file later.

2. Perform Sentiment Analysis:
   
   2.1. VADER'S Approach:
       To perform sentiment analysis using this tool, kindly open the "Vaders_sentiment_analysis.ipynb".
       Follow the steps mentioned in the Colab file, to install the required tools and packages, and import the required modules.
       Further, all the processes involved in the sentiment Analysis is clearly mentioned, for a easy user experience.
       Ensure to upload the right data file and make necessary changes in code to analyse the same.
       Run the code in the given order, to perform analysis.
       Run the code, to obtain the analysis results and sentiments of the particular Intel processor generation.

   2.2. DistilBERT Approach:
       To perform sentiment analysis using this tool, kindly open the "ML Sentiment Analyser.ipynb" file.
       The first few code blocks simply represent the DistilBERT model development and need not be run.
       Kindly, scroll till the "IMPLEMENTATION" section, to begin the sentiment analysis.
       Follow the steps mentioned in the Colab file, to install the required tools and packages, and import the required modules
       Follow the steps to perform the sentiment analysis.
       Ensure to upload the right dataset file.
       After performing the analysis, execute the further codes to extract and plot the results.
       Thus, you'd be able to obtain the user sentiment of the particular generation of Intel processors.
