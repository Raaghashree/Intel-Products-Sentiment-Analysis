4,R2XLUOMZDZXEH2,Mexico,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Excelente procesador y envío rápido,"Todo vino en orden, perfectamente empacado y completamente nuevo, el envío fue muy rápido, el procesador funciona de maravilla!"
5,R15Z5SQ4FHA4VL,Mexico,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Una maravilla de procesador,El tope de gama en su momento igual que el vendedor Zegucom de maravilla 100% Original no fake
6,RUIZMQC4IHLJ6,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Fast!,It is very fast but it also runs very hot when running at full load. Be sure to build with a liquid cooler.
7,REINASYU1V0GI,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,"A beast! Awesome, very powerful indeed.",This thing is a beast! Very powerful indeed.  Works flawlessly. I just finished building my desktop computer.  Very joyful to have and to play with.  I am very happy with the CPU.
8,R21AINR36VD93B,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Top of the line,"Great processor, well packaged. I like the wafer case. Very protected. Top of the line speed and quality"
9,R3ISO6HH9RN2QW,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Very fast!,"It’s very capable for modern gaming without disappearing the average user who games a lot. The stability is great. It’s very fast, it never stutters, and doesn’t disappoint. It’s well worth the money. With a proper 360mm AIO cooler, it doesn’t get too hot. I used an Asus TUF Gaming AIO cooler for gaming. It’s pretty easy to install."
10,R2N3O0DLAUGG1,United Kingdom,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Super fast CPU,"I just built a new gaming PC. MSI MAG Tomahawk motherboard, I9 14900k CPU, MSI Coreliquid S280 AIO, MSI 4090 Gaming X Trio, 2x WD Black SN850x SSDs, 64GB Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 RAM. It is a beast of a machine.CPU has never gone over 75c even playing games @ 4k, idle it sits around 40c. Gaming/rendering/photo and vidoe manipulation is effortless and super fast."
11,RAOA33V4BH4AJ,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Good CPU.,"Be careful with cooling. Try to keep under 75 celcious, so water cooling is the best option here. Great performance and stability is achieved under 75 degrees. Using it for 3d graphic rendering. 5 stars."
12,R33R0SQ9R1DW7D,United States,5,B0CQ1S3L53,Excellent CPU for the money.,Fast and runs cool. Very good graphics for CPU. Can game as long as you pair it with discrete GPU.
13,R39O08CVG3NIFQ,United States,5,B0CQ1S3L53,Thanks Amazon for fast shipping,"Upgrading from i5 6600. My new i3 is so cute im going to nickname it AWESOME! The cooler is very elegant. I hope it works! Thanks! Amazon for fast shipping arriving a day early and packaged nice!I was really excited about the cooler but the mounting mechanism is aweful. It dont clip dont nice now matter how hard i tried. Theres always one last clip just loose. I can reach on the backside and pop it off easily with my finger. I can understand people on a budget and needs to rely on this cooler and intel provides, Thanks! but i switched over to a cheap waterblock and i felt way more at ease.Intel skimped on the thermal paste. upon first installation i tried a game and it throttled my cpu with turbo boost on. I took the cooler off to try another cooler and looked at the paste it barely cover the cpu.I added more paste on top of intel paste and got a 15c drop and no more throttle. If you dont have better cooling solution i advise you get more thermal paste for sure.I test CPU on game COD MW3 before with intel 6600 i get 35-50fps with a lot of micro stutter.now with new intel i3 its getting 80-120fps smooth. and the fps counter saying its only using about 10-15 % cpu activity! im very happy. Thanks!"
14,R388FCDHOQW1RK,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,"This is a good processor, but remember it has E and P cores so thats annoying to find out later.","This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.  I'm sure it will play all the latest games just fine. and If it doesn't I can just pop in a different proc."
15,R3L6C1HVSQ4VL1,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Fast but do your research,"Overall this processor has worked well. I have had some minor issues with the PC crashing while playing games and I have not been able to pinpoint root cause. However, after doing some research, I did find that there are known issues with this processor. Had I known this prior to purchasing, I probably would have purchased a cheaper and more stable processor. Do your research prior to purchasing."
16,R2B75A8KKM7YFY,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Insane performance at a cost,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."
17,RZICJ4S1EBIL2,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Works but not the most stable,I'm using this as a server CPU mostly for the SR-IOV capable GPU stability has been an issue when running windows VM's on proxmox but in light of recent news about mainboard MFG's pushing the CPU too hard out of the box that may be the source of my stability issues as I mostly left the settings OOB for the CPU
18,RIEUW10WT6VL4,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Packaging could be improved,"The processor is great and arrived sealed in good condition, however, the cardboard box had no protection and it could easily be damaged if it fell."
19,R38KO6PSU3IQY6,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Main improvement is lower power cost day-day,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days."

21,RUGSS2D0S5EK5,Germany,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Hot in everyway,"Lot of power, enough for any game, especially if you add APO from intel but you need a good cooler because these run hot !Ps: also deactivate in your BIOS the auto tunning if you have an high end motherboard… these are pumping insane volts and watts in the cpu"
22,R3FBA2IAC31V60,Japan,4,B0CGJ41C9W,いいと思う,次の世代に
23,RA15RLSQS7747,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Good for price,"I'm definitely gonna upgrade later but this is handling itself pretty well with dragon dogma 2 to fortnite and everything in-between, only gripe is that there's no small arrow on the actual CPU to indicate where to place it on motherboard so if you tossed the packaging without looking you might be bit confused with orientation otherwise good."
24,R39TRGSB3OGFSW,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Well packaged and performed perfectly,"No issues with this seller or product, but for those that are looking for a new PC part the 14900 k is merely a refinement over the 13900k which you may be able to find cheaper."
25,R2TTMEWCLXX4ZD,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Great performance,"This is an excellent, stable CPU. Care must be taken to keep it cool. It is a hot running CPU. To avoid heat throttling at 100deg Celsius in heavy duty gaming or testing, order a high end liquid cooler. For professional work and easy gaming a big block fan cooler will be just fine as it is much more quiet. To save a little  money, if at all, the I9-13900K will work just as well performance wise."
26,R1C9FDL5NAB28K,Mexico,5,B0CGJDBCTK,En excelente estado,"El procesador llego bien empacado y con sus condiciones y funcionalidad excelente, cumple con todo; no tiene disipador de stock, pero hay tener en cuenta que para este tipo de procesadores es necesario un disipador de calor más eficiente que los que vienen en otros procesadores"
27,RYB540W4OQV7R,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Hot,Runs hot but runs very well needs a good good good cooler

29,R69VREKOD5HNU,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Solid CPU,It's been great so far. Clocking right and no overheating. Currently paired with a phanteks 360mm AIO.
30,R216ZXRP7P8JJ,Italy,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Prestazioni ottime: Recensione del processore Intel Core™ i7-14700KF,"Questo processore è una vera e propria potenza che soddisferà le esigenze dei gamer, degli utenti professionali e di coloro che cercano il massimo delle prestazioni nel proprio PC. Con una frequenza base di 3.6 GHz e una frequenza boost massima di 5.0 GHz consente di gestire efficacemente carichi di lavoro pesanti, rendendolo ideale per attività come il rendering video, il gaming e la produzione multimediale.Per i gamer più esigenti, il Core™ i7-14700KF offre prestazioni grafiche straordinarie grazie alla compatibilità con le schede grafiche più recenti e alle tecnologie avanzate come l'Intel® Deep Learning Boost, che migliora le prestazioni dell'intelligenza artificiale nei giochi e nelle applicazioni di realtà virtuale. Personalmente faccio anche molto editing video e non ho mai riscontrato problemi o rallentamenti con DaVinci Resolve o Premiere.Prezzo altino ma purtroppo oggi giorno i prezzi sono questi."
31,R3596CHMS2FFBI,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Much faster than my previous i7-6850k,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"
32,R1YD4D3AQ5GW44,Germany,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Looks good,"Haven't installed yet but looks fine. Die size is 30x40 mm, meaning 0,3 ml/0,8 g is the perfect amount of thermal paste (not included). I'll put 5 dots."
33,R33TSZ8RS04ZC5,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Can you say SCREAM!,"This is the first time I've ever went for it and got an i9. I usually stick to the i7. I am so glad I decided to take the chance because this thing screams. To think that I can also squeeze out more by overclocking is just insane. Every application I've ran is so snappy and responsive. Being an impatient human, this thing makes me happier every time I turn it on. Power and Speed are right where I like it. This chip is just so damn sweet!"
34,R2ZQJRJX5594AA,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,This is a BEAST and runs hot.  But that's OK!,"Even you're getting hotter temps despite having great cooling, it's normal for this CPU.  It's a beast.  I recommend using a triple-fan-radiator AIO cooler to keep this bad boy as cool as possible. And make sure to blow the hot air OUT of your PC case."
35,R3OD3WLMV5P772,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Intel® Core™ i7-14700K,"This new Intel® Core™ i7-14700K New Gaming Desktop Processor with 20 cores just rocks! Cooling it with an Noctua NH-U12A, Premium CPU Cooler with High-Performance Quiet NF-A12x25 PWM Fans (120mm, Brown) for Desktop."
36,RB452R546HM0O,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Love it,Super easy to install. Just update your motherboard bios to support 14 Gen
37,R28IGAI4HXN1V1,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,"WoW, Powerful processor from Intel","WoW! What a beast, intel i7 14700K! it can handle any tasks in pc as game and everyday use.  No issues with it. Thanks for fast shipping!"
38,R3USTP49MAKDM6,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Runs HOT - Get a good cooler!,"I paired this with a ""GIGABYTE Z790 Eagle AX LGA 1700 Intel Z790 ATX Motherboard with DDR5, M.2, PCIe 5.0, USB 3.2 Gen2X2 Type-C, Intel Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5GbE LAN, Q-Flash Plus, EZ-Latch"" mobo and TGDGAMER ""T-240MM Black ARGB Liquid CPU Water Cooling with 240mm ARGB PWM Fan, Temperature Display, Computer Water Cooling"". The Intel application used AI to tweak my CPU to squeeze out more performance, but under 100% load it will often thermally throttle and sporadically hit 100C. I am considering finding a better cooler to keep up with this racehorse."
39,R2ZFYKE8BBNGCK,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Great Processor!,I build it my new editing PC and use this 14th generation processor (24 cores and 32 threads).
40,R2WXY6BWBYB3SL,Germany,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Immer genug Leistung,"vorhanden, bleibt mit ausreichend Kühlung auch im gaming Betrieb auf ca 60 Grad."
41,R2J8RHPWO247Y,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Best cpu,"The Intel i9-14900K delivers impressive performance with its high clock speeds and advanced architecture. It excels in demanding tasks like gaming, content creation, and multitasking, offering smooth and responsive performance. The integrated graphics are decent for light gaming and multimedia tasks. However, it's power-hungry and may require robust cooling solutions. Overall, it's a top choice for enthusiasts and power users seeking uncompromising performance."
42,R3HB7S64V1X9CB,Mexico,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Rápido y con buena atención,El producto llego antes de los esperado y en buenas condiciones. Lo cual se agradece mucho. Estare probando en los próximos días
43,R2A3ZKL5BA7GU1,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Careful shipment,Everything was great
44,RYC07J7PB0OQ0,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Scores well with cinebench,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.  The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad. Enjoying my thermal right air cooler it does a great job for half the cost of my older noctua cooler on my prior haswell i7.
45,R2JIZ4V3O7DXAY,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Great Performance!,"Upgrading from a 10700KF to 14700K. Lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but I’m here to tell you it’s well worth the money! Just make sure to go to your BIOS and limit the power to 253W. The whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion. I haven’t gotten heat issues while gaming.Overall I have this chip paired with a 3090, while I’ll wait for a new 50 series card.Some of the gains I’ve gotten at @1440P, 45 in ultra wide 21:9, max graphics settings:Overwatch: overall 50fps gain, consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor.Black Desert Online: overall 35-40 fps gains.These are the games I normally play a lot and it’s truly notice when upgrading to this chip. Overall the computer is a snappy and fast and haven’t notice any hiccups. Really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4-5 years."
46,R2FLCRTOTFGFTM,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."

After upgrading from a Ryzen 3700x to this, my work speed, gaming, everything cannot lay a finger on this thing. The only time's i've seen this truly cap out is during extreme compression, decompression, and specific rendering situations. The only con which isn't truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly HOT. If you're going to get this? I would absolutely suggest a 360 AIO cooler or you're going to experience thermal throttling, or even thermal shutdowns. That was my original issue, but quickly upgraded coolers, and this thing is a MONSTER."

62,R2M5VTUUWL5M7F,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Runs good after Bios update and adjustments to settings,I was afraid to purchase the 14th gen after all the talk of stability issues. When the the Bios fixes were mentioned I took a shot. I'm up and running with the power limits adjusted accordingly.
63,RGRL7K3DN15BQ,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Super Strong CPU,"The CPU is really strong for both gaming and video-editing/movie creation. Haven't had any issues within the past 6 months I've had this. Never gave any issues, no malfunctions and it never stutters and this is without O.C. the CPU."
64,R6WV0R24P4PMH,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,She’s a hot one,"I upgraded from a12700k with asus tuf z690 board and a arctic air 360 AIO. The 12700 K ran at about 50°C gaming.The 14700k runs in the mid 60s. The 12700k Cinebench score and  temp was 22600/71c. The 14700k was 32000/87c . Still below throttling, which is OK according to Intel . When gaming I only see maybe five frames per second faster at 2k res .this is a good chip. Don’t get me wrong. with as many cores as this has, and the speed it should last for a long time, it far exceeds the needs of any. New or future games."
65,R1ZP35ZM9GATPY,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."
66,R376SSK49RKNZJ,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Powerful!,"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste."

68,R1JJNMJQQW5A1B,Japan,5,B0CGJDBCTK,7700ｋから乗り換え,7700ｋがwindows11に対応していないのでそろそろ新しいPCを組まなければと思いこちらを選びました。今までずっとｋ付きのi7を使ってきたので今回もそうしました。7700ｋが消費電力91ｗなのにこちらは253ｗとあり、目玉が飛び出しました。7700ｋは虎徹で十分に冷えましたがこちらは無理そうで、クーラーはDeepCoolのAK620を選びました。125ｗに電力制限をかければ70度程度に落ち着き、安心して使えそうです。グリスの塗り方を適切にすればもう少し下がりそうに思います。肝心の使用感ですが、論理コア含めて28コアもあるのでよほどの作業をしても重くならないという安心感があります。僕の使用状況を考えるとオーバースペックなのですが、あとになって性能が足りないと後悔するよりも、性能の高い方を買って十分なものを買ったんだと安心するほうが僕の性に合っています。僕がi7を買い続ける理由はこの安心感なのです。電力制限が必要なのも僕にとっては利点です。普段は125ｗに制限をかけておけば、いざというときに制限を解除できるという安心感につながるからです（いざというときなんてきっと来ません。分かっています）今回のi7も十分な安心感を買えたと思います。
69,R3F9GNKX1BOL4D,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Better than 13th gen,"I previously purchased the 13th Gen version of this processor and it had a defect. Intel was very good at getting a refund sent via RMA, although it took awhile. I purchased this version instead and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my issues resolved. The CPU can handle almost everything thrown at it. Certainly a good purchase and better than the 13th gens that seem to have more issues."
70,R30LK532BOKSQN,Japan,5,B0CGJDBCTK,性能は抜群、コスパは・・。,性能は素晴らしいですが、やはり発熱もトップクラスですね。本格水冷（30㎝ラジエター*3台）で回してますが、それでも無制限のままだとサーマルスロットリングをちょいちょい突きます。定格では最高でも80度行きませんが、無制限の場合電圧のVFカーブをちょっと弄ってやると安定します。現在最高でも89℃と扱いやすくなってます。ただ、電気代の事を考えると正直コスパ面で良い方ではないと思います。エンコードなどその分速度が十分に上がってますが、その分の電気代・・。性能面では最高で満足してます。
71,R1M26QHSSRS8VR,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Powerful CPU!,"This CPU is POWERFUL! It ran smoother and was able to open/load programs much faster than my Ryzen 7 5700G.

74,R3W573K0PBIKLE,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,The beast! Be prepared to cool it!,It's the current Intel flagship desktop CPU.We had to upgrade from 120mm to 240mm liquid coolers for it.IMPORTANT NOTE: You may need to manually set the max power and max amps in the bios. There's currently an issue that causes them to be set to insanely high values (4096W) by default causing the chip to become unstable under heavy loads.
75,RMFQ4JLJY0KHW,Mexico,5,B0CGJDBCTK,El GOAT,"De los mejores procesadores del mercado. Excelente para cualquier tipo de tarea exigente. Pero es importante combinarlo con una buena refrigeración líquida o tendrá cuello térmico.Tuve que pedirlo 2 veces porque el primero tenía un error de hardware muy común en estos procesadores, un problema en la compilación de shaders que crashea en algunos juegos o programas. El segundo que pedí llegó sin ningún problema."
76,RNMDB7NXG4NPQ,Japan,4,B0CGJ41C9W,酷評されているけど,"13600Kとほとんど差がなく酷評されていますが、お値段もほぼ差がないのでどちらを選んでも良いと思います。実用的な面で言うと、パルワールドを最高画質設定で起動(更に拠点パル数最大＆観賞用ケージ複数設置)かつ、iPadからモバイルゲーム画面取り込み、OBSで複数シーン構成で配信、Tiktok live studioで1080P60 8000kbpsで配信、コメント読み上げ(わんコメ、Voicebox, 棒読みちゃん)起動、Androidのエミュレータ起動この条件下でCPU使用率はまだ半分ほど余裕があり温度も60℃に達しません。(RAM20GB、VRAM9GB使用)CPU以外のパーツの構成にもよりますが、十分使えるCPUと言えると思います。追記添付画像は実際にパルワールドを最高画質設定で起動し各種配信ツールを起動させている状態でのスコアです。"

78,R21AXZ7JJMBCK8,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU,"Wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time. All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version."

82,R3TZXD6EMMF6WT,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Excellent performance for general purpose use,As a Gamer/Data Scientist/Programmer/Tinker I wanted a mainstream CPU built by a well established company. With Intel's i9-14900K CPU I have a top of the line general purpose chip which provides above average performance in all the computational fields I have an interest in. I only gave it a 4-star rating because I had hoped that Intel would have brought the 15th generation chips out in 2023 Q4 as they said rather than just the mobile chips.

84,R1QHSD89OFXZEB,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,This is thing is super hot.,"May be a little excessive and unnecessary, but glad I got one when I did.  Sometimes these things get hard to acquire, especially at a decent price.Seems to run a little hotter than my Ryzen 9 7950X, so I went with dual 420mm,  If you buy this CPU you should really consider custom loops or large cases with 420mm AIO support."
85,R2VBKAO25C80NC,United States,4,B0CGJ41C9W,Decent upgrade over I7 8700,Upgrade from an I7 8700 to this. Temps are crazy when gaming but my water cooling setup helps keep it mostly stable.

89,R2V5SSL6O74A1F,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Killer Processor,"In 2020 I made the mistake of switching to AMD. The system I built was so annoying. The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed. Slowed everything down and made a lot of unnecessary noise. With my new Intel-based system, those issues are gone, and I have a lightning fast PC. Learned my lesson about AMD!"
90,R20IUQVDXR3MMQ,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Much fast,Able to compile rust code way faster now.
91,RV5Q9IQ5VGR3Z,Saudi Arabia,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Good choice,Instead of buying i9 buy this and you will get 20 cores and safe alot of money
92,R17L5SI6CTQAHU,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Blazing Fast Performance with Intel Core i9-14919K,"The Intel Core i9-14900K processor is a beast when it comes to gaming and multitasking. With its 24-core configuration (8 Performance-cores and 16 Efficiency-cores), this CPU handles everything from intense gaming sessions to heavy-duty content creation smoothly and without a hitch.

93,R1R7C0QZIH5CBV,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,AMAZING BEAST,AMAZING AND RECEIVED SO QUICK! <3
94,R1YW2IQD49R1M2,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,Best value for power,I was able to get 240fps in CS go and valorant without external GPU.I previously had 6th gen i7 and GTX980. And that couldn't pull this.Lightroom rendering is also good i am able to color correct 100 raw pics in seconds.I didn't expect this performance when i updated.
95,R502RF7DUUKBT,United States,5,B0CGJDBCTK,i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."

100,RZY3SH7UMSUEO,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Unstable at default oc settings on asus motherboard,Even running at the default 6.1ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing.  Only way to stop it is to go in bios and set the core ratio to 57 max for power cores and 43 for efficency cores. Drove me nuts trying to figure out the problem for months also buy a hefty duty power supply if you're buying a 40 series rtx graphics card constant crashing of apps and games from lack of power to the graphics card from even a 1000 watt supply

104,RKAP6LX7MG7HI,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,Powerful but Warm,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."

It's like any other processor that processes, only better.It destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in Corel Painter. It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code.Just remember to update your BIOS because it's still a relatively new processor. And stay away from Windows 11."

110,RVXXWX1GGB3GX,United States,5,B0CGJDKLB8,I MADE IT WORK,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .

120,RGWWVLEZTYN3L,United States,3,B0CGJDKLB8,Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.

My 360 AIO mount is not the issue, as temps hover around 90-93c when stress testing at 253w. I'm also using a contact frame. I'm thinking the issue might be the increased voltage at the stock 5.7 all core frequencies, because my power usage has increased a lot while gaming. Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies. I've set up a Thermal Velocity Boost profile where 80c drops to 5.6, and 90c drops to 5.5, with e-cores at 4.3... and the issues are basically gone. Ridiculous that this has to be done though."

Yes, I had to adjust System Voltage via BIOS to ensure system stability, otherwise the game will crash which I recommend to set it between 1.11 V - 1.15V, otherwise leaving it by default may push SA voltage to around 2.10 - 3.00 V which is very dangerous to your memory controller. Yes, IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) does matter when it comes to RAM overclocking, however, not all RAM and CPU can achieve same clockspeed and volage due to silicon lottery. Other than that, I'm happy with the results, able to run much higher framerate, no frame drop during livestreaming via OBS and works perfectly fine with ASUS Apex Encore Z790 Motherboard.P.S.  You may have to turn on Intel SVID default behavior to ensure system stability which you may have to download & flash the latest UEFI BIOS, regardless your motherboard vendor such as ASUS, MSI, GIGABYTE, EVGA, Biostar, etc.All in all, I recommend this product if you have sufficient cooling but also want to achieve much higher clock speed via better binning.

175,RMRCN4AEKANH9,United States,5,B0CXHMTHWP,Disappointing Performance-to-Price Ratio.,"The Intel® Core™ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor arrives with much anticipation, boasting impressive specifications on paper. However, a closer examination reveals that this processor falls short of delivering the expected value for its price tag.At first glance, the i9-14900KS appears promising, with its high clock speeds and purported performance enhancements. However, when put to the test, it becomes evident that the marginal improvements over its predecessors do not justify the hefty price premium attached to it.One of the major drawbacks of the i9-14900KS is its lackluster performance gains in real-world scenarios. Despite the incremental upgrades in clock speeds and architecture, users may find that the difference in performance compared to previous generations is negligible in most tasks, from gaming to content creation.Moreover, the i9-14900KS faces stiff competition from rival processors, such as those from AMD's Ryzen lineup, which offer comparable performance at a more reasonable price point. In terms of value for money, the i9-14900KS simply does not measure up, as consumers can find better alternatives that provide similar or even superior performance without breaking the bank.Furthermore, the i9-14900KS's power consumption and thermal management remain areas of concern. Despite being marketed as a high-performance processor, it tends to run hot under heavy workloads, requiring robust cooling solutions to prevent thermal throttling and maintain stable operation.In conclusion, while the Intel® Core™ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor may appeal to enthusiasts seeking the latest and greatest hardware, its lack of significant performance improvements and unfavorable price-to-performance ratio makes it a hard sell for the average consumer. With more cost-effective options available on the market, investing in the i9-14900KS may not be the wisest decision for those looking to maximize their computing power without breaking the bank."

180,RQBOPJ2G1J3QR,United States,1,B0CGJDKLB8,BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built."

The instability seemed incurable so I returned everything and switched to the 7950x3d… and it just worked straight out of the box, runs so much cooler and less power draw, with no crashes.

I avoided buying RAM that can go 8000Mhz with XMP because there are so very many failures with those--and I wanted 8000 because I wanted a system with no bottlenecks as much as possible.Runs great for about 5 to 30 minutes. Temps run from 30s to 50s to high 80s bouncing up and down like normal. Then BOOM BSODs.I will do tests including memory, cpu, and double check drivers.Most websites point to a CPU issue. Some mention RAM or drivers.I'm either going to solve this issue or return this i9-14900 CPU and replace it with an i9-13900.I hope to remember this review and update it with success info."

190,R1A9OM6HFH6L26,United States,1,B0CGJDKLB8,BUYER BEWARE,I have written a couple of dozen reviews on Amazon and this is only my second negative review.  I placed an order for a brand new Intel 14700K CPU from Amazon and it arrived as an Open Box (the factory seal had been cut and the processor was jammed into the packaging at an odd angle.  I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing.  I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.  I purchased an identical CPU from another source and that CPU booted up with no issues (it is running the PC I am typing this review on) so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that Amazon shipped to me.
191,R330GDX361WY0O,Canada,1,B0CGJDKLB8,"until the kinks are worked out, not even a little bit worth the price.","I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."

They come out of the box with maxed out settings, including a nearly unlimited 5000w (yes, thousand) available power draw. Intel customer support will ask you to manually configure the BIOS to a setting that effectively renders it a very expensive i7. Wait until they get this fixed, if it's even possible, unless you just really like underclocking and BSODs"
193,R1FEWHJHKMB8PD,United States,1,B0CGJDKLB8,A Carefully Engineered Nightmare,"I'm a game developer and decided to switch from AMD to Intel for my latest build. The amount of problems this CPU has caused me has cost me hundreds of hours of work. I've been building computers for over 20 years and this is by far the absolute worst component of all time. E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade. It gave the illusion of stability through the return period so I'm now stuck with a $500 paper weight CPU and motherboard."
194,R1MULU9MNZ9B0R,United States,1,B0CGJDKLB8,AVOID THIS PROCESSOR AT ALL COSTS / 13th/14th gen Intel i7-i9 issues,"Where do I begin... In between the stability issues this causes, the blue screens of death, the fact that you can't run even Minesweeper due to the problems this processor causes, the ""lack of video resources"" not caused by the GPU but rather by the CPU, the constant need for undervolting of a so-called high end chip, the overheating of the processor, the fact that Intel stayed quiet about this and STILL hasn't taken any action so far, that so many customers have been forced to ask for returns, or the fact that this was hushed for so long that it'll be a miracle to get a refund... Disappointment is still too light a term to refer to what went on with these processors. Honestly, this already falls within a product recall territory, and it's both a scam and an insult to every potential customer out there."
195,R1D0S9BANHB7E,United States,1,B0CGJDKLB8,Horrible Efficiency,"overall intel is great for a work station, HOWEVER the 14 series is stupid as hell... it offers NO benefit in 99.9% of situations over 13 series... I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash..."

Intel needs to recall this product and refund everyone.  I replaced every part on my new PC build only to find out the issues was this Intel CPU (amazon 30 day warranty had already expired by then).  I'm now having to wait for months attempting to get a refund from intel.  This is a well-known issue and Intel refuses to admit and recall product

Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.  Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it.  When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner."

Now 2 months later the computer will no longer boot without BSoD. All other hardware has been replaced meaning the chip is absolutely the issue. Currently in the process of RMA negotiations with intel because diagnosis took longer than the amazon return window. So far their service has been slow to respond. Until intel admits to the faults in these generations and offers an actual fix i would suggest sticking to AMD. I wish i had.I personally never overclocked the card, never had the chance, it wasn't very stable on default settings. Had a ticket with intel since 3 days ago, they havent reaponded in 2 days.

La incógnita de no saber que tanto estrés se le metió al procesador antes de enviarlo es complicada, cuando se esperaba un producto nuevo.Actualización: El procesador en efecto venía dañado, el primero problema fue que impedía la instalación de Windows. La forma de verificar la falla fue entrando a la BIOS y desactivando todos los cores, a posterior fui activando uno por uno. Con un solo núcleo permitió instalar Windows, el resumen fue: todos los E-cores funcionaban, de los P-Cores estaban dañados el 4, 6 y 7 ya que al encender cualquiera de esos tres desde la BIOS, generaba pantallas azules, se freezeaba o cerraba programas aleatoriamente.No descarto que el tema haya sido un problema de fábrica, pero desde que llegó con pasta térmica en los bordes, me hacía sospechar que había algo malo con el procesador, ya se realizó la solicitud de reembolso."

205,R3CYO79U1JTY4T,United States,1,B0CGJDKLB8,"Absolute scam, stay away!","This CPU is a scam. I spent four months debugging my new system, went through three motherboards, two sets of RAM and countless hours of debugging and trying, just to figure out that this CPU is garbage. I can't get my system stable, it keeps failing. This CPU is so overclocked that it does not run stable. Ever. Safe your money, times and nerves and stay as far away from this CPU as you can. I will never buy Intel again."
206,R3E3ZCB7W9I1J0,United States,4,B0CGJC178L,"Fast, but unstable when overclocked.","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."

Im BIOS war ersichtlich, dass der PCI- Steckplatz nicht belegt war.Ein BIOS- Update des Mainboards (F3->F9b) hat dieses Problem nun auch behoben. Hier hat Youtube auch wieder geholfen.Jetzt bin ich erstmal sehr zu frieden mit dem Rechner. Natürlich werden die Zocker jetzt sagen, dass hier ein Ungleichgewicht zwischen Grafikkarte und CPU besteht. Da ich allerdings mehr an Softwareentwicklung als an Spielen interessiert bin, passt das für mich. Um mit dem System ordentlich spielen zu können, müsste wenigstens eine RTX 4070 oder Ähnliches verbaut werden.Alles in Allem bin ich sehr zufrieden, der Leistungssprung ist natürlich enorm zu dem 10 Jahre alten i4790k Prozessor, wobei hier der zwangsläufige Wechsel von DDR3 auf DDR5- RAM auch seinen Beitrag leistet. Von der wahnsinnig schnellen M.2 SSD ganz zu schweigen.Mir ist klar, dass der CPU-Cooler etwas schwach ausgelegt ist, aber mein Gehäuse hat nicht mehr an Platz her gegeben und mal ehrlich: Ich habe nicht vor den Prozessor mit 250W Dauerlast zu betreiben."

268,R1L382QFTGM6T0,Germany,5,B0CHBFWJDN,Nice but a bit overpriced.,Pretty nice but architecture wise it's not that radically advanced from a 13 gen i7.Still I like how balanced the performance is. Multithreaded tasks work like a charm. It's actually very stable with high speed RAM modules. And for gaming everyone tells how AMD's 7950X3D is better but honestly I find absolutely zero issues to deal with. Missing out on 5% FPS speed is something I'd rather have than dealing with switching between the 3DV CCD and a 7950X's CCD messing up qith performance or the inability to overclock (plus zero issues with asus rog motherboards)

275,R1QQ843F2TKPBT,United States,3,B0CQ1P2TRN,Not for me but it is a good CPU,"I ordered 14700F because I need a CPU that has similar performance compared with 14700k but consumes less power, and I was wrong about it.1st of all, the CPU cooler come with the CPU is too weak and it limit the CPU to 65w with continuously load.The 65w power limitation severely undercut CPU performance and I get about 20,000 with Cinebench R23.A powerful cooler is definitely needed to cool down the CPU allowing it to run at 220w.With 220w on the 14700F, Cinebench R23 score has reached 33,000.For me, when 14700f paired with the original cooler, the 65w CPU is too weak for my need.In the meantime, with a powerful cooler, 14700f performs close (but not as fast) as 14700k and the 220w power consumption is not much difference compared with 14700kf's 250w PL2.Considering the price between 14700f and 14700kf, there is not much wattage difference between them.With this reason, I have decided to return it.Bottom line,For a price conscious buyer, then I think I5 is better choice because it is cheaper but performs similar compared to 14700f run at 65 watt.If you need more computing power like me, then I think14700k is a better buy."

Upgrading from the Intel i7 10700k to the 14th gen is just insanity. It offers a huge boost in performance in every day usage - including gaming, video editing, development and AI.For anyone not looking too much into the technical side of things - if you're already looking at this product, you already made up your mind - my review isn't going to change it ;-) if you're on a CPU currently 4/5 generations behind, this is the upgrade you want."

Ansonsten ist er ganz ok, aber enttäuscht bin schon."
288,R3BF3Q93WCABVW,Germany,3,B0CHBFWJDN,The problem is that the CPU die is too small.,"For the effective heat transfer to be better the CPU die would have to be larger. More surface contact with pump would increase effective cooling. That is my only complaint.The concentrated heat in the processor make it hard for the cooler / pump to keep the temps down. No matter the size of the cooler the heat transfer is the bottleneck for cooling of the CPU.The processor will no matter the cooler reach 100°C in about 30 seconds under full load. To keep the temps down you need to throttle power limits in motherboard BIOS and lose some performance. But effectively if you do so, CPU will no longer cap at 100°C, but be somewhere under 80°C, on average 60-70°C.Other than that its a beast."

I didn't realize this was such an unstable CPU when I bought it, then the more I used it and more research I did I finally realized that this CPU is unstable and was pushed to the physical limit. Don't get your hopes up, maybe you'll get a lucky CPU and you know how to stabilize it via bios. Realized too late to return, so I have to RMA and hopefully I get a CPU that have issues such as; crashes, freeze, out of video memory error, blue screen, lose tabs, open app then crash, open twice to open program, etc etc problems. Idk I just feel let down by intel on this one. My CPU is not stable with intel baseline defaults for this KS chip which is the extreme, and thats what I paid for so..... yeah if you know what youre doing maybe get it, but if you don't have the BIOS mastery to fix this CPU I would idk, reconsider. Try another Intel CPU that has better reviews.I will update when I find a resolution from RMA process with Intel."
298,R1WQM9T3DJY6JI,Canada,1,B0CXHMTHWP,"CRC Failures, Blue Screens, Crashes","I've had the worst luck with 14th Gen i9 bins. After only 1 month of overall decent stability, I'm just now starting to get random CRC failures when extracting archives, blue screens, game crashes; even despite having run on Intel's new power profiles since the start (from post-May-deadline set by Intel on Motherboard manufacturers) designed to avoid damaging the CPUs while Intel explores their RMA nightmare; and this CPU still managed to experience serious degradation not unlike other high end i9s in the Raptor Lake Refresh.I've already upgraded from a 14900K to a 14900KS (14900K lasted 6 months before RMA too), but this 14900KS here only lasted less than 30 days before 14th gen CPU-gate issues struck again, and it is absolutely eating this new 14900KS alive.Edit: As of this writing (June 15 2014), there is a microcode update that Intel will be pushing to BIOS vendors to fix a bug in CPU causing the CPU's Extended Adaptive Thermal Boost parameters to be set too high, which apparently is a contributing factor.  I don't believe it will necessarily fix the sudden physical depredation that my CPU has already undergone, however, I would advise anyone interested to steer clear of 14th Gen i9's until Intel has root-caused the hardware issues to prevent anyone getting stuck in a ""try-break-RMA-repeat"" support loop until this is all more understood.I miss having a reliable CPU, but right now this one ain't it."
299,R3NLK3YDNVQYIC,United States,1,B0CXHMTHWP,Research Stability Before Buying,"I had this CPU for two months and I will have BSOD problems a few times per day. Even during present time. Some examples would be Watchdog errors, IO Exception, and out of memory errors. Any Riot Games game will require you to install an anti-cheat software for all games, which has kernel level access. That said, playing any game at all, even without having Riot Vanguard as a running process will crash your computer anyway.I had this purchased before videos were released regarding the numerous issues to 13th and 14th gen intel CPUs, so my return window is expired. In short, stay away from 13th and 14th generations and stick to 12th gen and below."

Nope. First day was fine, games worked great, CPU worked flawlessly. The next morning, first game I booted up crashed. Thought that was odd, tried again, and crashed again. Within about 15 minutes, I could no longer even open games that used UE5. Constant crashing in other CPU heavy tasks. I spent 8 hours troubleshooting my PC and doing research into the issue to come to the conclusion that everyone else having these symptoms also had i9-13900/14900 KS CPUs. Despite following the advice from ASUS and applying the intel CPU profile in the UEFI, the problems have returned and continue to get worse.Save your money, and save yourself the frustration and heartache, buy a different CPU."

332,R2WE50VDNJMVAX,Italy,5,B0CHBFWJDN,Cpu Flight simulator 2020,"Ho cambiato tutto il pc in funzione di msfs2020 ,prima avevo una cpu 9700k che con la rtx 3080 non era proprio il massimo,adesso con il 14700k la differenza si vede soprattutto negli atterraggi ,tutto fila liscio senza balbuzie ,ho guadagnato almeno 15fps su msfs2020 ,un processore molto potente che in vista di un aggiornamento di una  scheda video (4090)potra supportare senza problemi , adesso finalmente ho una cpu adeguata alla scheda video, posso solo che consigliarlo !"
333,R3191ZF695HICC,Italy,5,B0CHBFWJDN,CPU ok,"CPU arrivata regolarmente il giorno dopo spedita da Amazon, confezione perfettamente integra e sigillata, cpu ok."
334,R15NSZ7L7L5X0L,Italy,5,B0CHBFWJDN,CPU Intel Core i7-14700K,"Ottimo processore.Non essendoci modifiche architetturali tra i processori Core 13000 e 14000, ha permesso a Intel di conservare la compatibilità con le piattaforme socket LGA 1700. Questo vuol dire che,chi possiede una piattaforma serie 600 o 700 può installare il Core i7-14700K assicurandosi prima di aggiornare il BIOS - sempre tenendo conto di avere una scheda madre adeguata per far rendere la CPU al massimo.Super consigliata.Un punto a favore anche ad Amazon con tempi e trasporto impeccabili."
335,R21O8MBE5CC9N6,Germany,5,B0CHBFWJDN,einwandfrei,Entspricht der Beschreibung
336,R3090WUORHKIAQ,Italy,5,B0CHBFWJDN,Ottimo,"Non ci sono modifiche architetturali tra i processori Core 13000 e 14000 né al processo produttivo. L'assenza di modifiche ha permesso a Intel di conservare la compatibilità con le piattaforme socket LGA 1700 introdotte con il primo processore ibrido desktop della sua storia, il Core 12000 Alder Lake.Questo significa che chi possiede una piattaforma serie 600 o 700 può installare il Core i7-14700K assicurandosi prima di aggiornare il BIOS - sempre tenendo conto di avere una scheda madre adeguata per far rendere la CPU al massimo."
337,RGVCOZN46M5D7,United Kingdom,5,B0CHBFWJDN,Good quality as always.,All good.
338,RW2BX2HQCO2W6,United States,4,B0CXHMTHWP,Good but be prepared for returns,"This is for the 14900ks. I had to order 3 before I received a stable one. The problematic chips would power off my system randomly which only increased in frequency. They also wouldn’t be stable even with Intel’s baseline profile. No amount of thermal grease, reseating or troubleshooting would fix it. If you want this chip be prepared to go through a few returns before you get a good one. For the stable 14900ks it decently edges out my 13900k. It gives a little extra processing power for single core performance. Which is exactly what I needed for my audio processing.Performance comes at a cost. This chip runs hot. 90c under load with 420mm Arctic AIO and Kryonaut extreme.  Although I have one core which is a top performer and doesn’t exceed 82c . Good luck!!"
339,R3D5YEH7NY19NO,Canada,4,B0CXHMTHWP,Got lucky with a good bin,"I went through 3 of these processors, with another vendor. It was the Amazon one that I got that gave me a good bin and system stability.The previous ones were so bad that my system was unstable at stock settings.SP  109SP Pcore 126SP Ecore  79SP MC  88You might get lucky too, but don't bank on bin lottery. It might not happen.These chips should have never happened. 13k should have been the last chip of this design.The 14ks runs extremely hot, even on a custom loop. Be aware, you'll need minimum a 360mm long by 45mm thick radiator. I use a 65mm thick radiator in a custom loop and that's adequate, kind of. If going the AIO route I suggest Arctic. Most other manufacturers make AIOs thag may be too thin to cool this CPU."
340,R1QRY4UENV59KI,United States,5,B0CGJ9STNF,Works Great for High End Gaming and Average Workloads,"I got this CPU because I've been a long term Intel user and I have never had problems with them. This one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work (mostly Office, Internet content) and gaming (COD MW3). In terms of power consumption and heat generation, I can hardly notice it since all the workload I put on it hardly heats it up more than 45C-50C. I'm not a video/photo content creator nor a streamer, so this works for me. For example, while playing COD MW3 and Ultra settings the CPU use is about 2% while my GPU, RTX 3080, carries 98% of the bottleneck workload."
341,RVMTZAR14NCT9,United States,5,B0CGJ9STNF,fast,"Coming from a ryzen 5 3500, this cpu is fast!"
342,R3TT1IH50TGLNN,Japan,5,B0CGJ9STNF,評判はあまりよくないが。。,6700Kからこちらに変更あまり進化していないと評判はよくはありませんがさすがの性能です
343,R3RWY8TZ8IXZEF,United States,5,B0CQ1MN1Y2,Good price and reliable for gaming,Toms Hardware recommended this processor so I gave it a shot. Have not been disappointed.
344,RDKIQ0HH9G3JA,United States,5,B0CQ1MN1Y2,"Great for gaming, don't listen to the everyone saying it's not enough.","A lot of people will say that i3s are not enough in 2024 and can't run anything. Couldn't be further from the truth. This cpu is good enough more than 90-95% of people. If you know this cpu isn't powerful enough for your work, then you are in that 5%.For gaming and for basic office/school work, this cpu is unmatched when it comes to price vs performance. The cooler it comes with had an interesting mounting mechanism but it keeps my CPU nice and cool. I've been playing Hogwart's Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 at 1080p on ultra settings with my Arc A580.Also I managed to snag this at $95 brand new, so basically I was forced to buy it at that point or facepalm myself."
345,R302JVYNLOKBAJ,Japan,5,B0CQ1MN1Y2,普通に動いています,ゲームはやらないので、ネット閲覧や写真の整理、書類作成では不満なく普通に使えています。このような使い方では処理速度は問題ではないので12100でもよかったかなと思っています。長く使えることを期待しています。
346,R3PUMAI08D2YRM,United States,5,B0CQ1MN1Y2,Big dummy,"The processor can in fine. I thought I was being smart by buying the newest 14th gen. My motherboard cannot use it, it can only use 12th and 13th gen. So I orederd the proper processor and everything is lovely now. Out smarted myself big dummie."
347,R2KE5N6IR4SQBJ,United States,5,B0CQ1MN1Y2,Son says this is great,My son recently upgraded his computer and we bought this for him. He says it works great and he’s happy with it. Good value for what we got.
348,R39GWJY09ZQ60N,United States,5,B0CQ1MN1Y2,Great pc part works perfect,Worked perfectly for fortnite and comes with a fan
349,R3JVZTXU8DXMZP,United States,5,B0CQ1MN1Y2,Cost/benefit ratio better than a comparable AMD,"A friend told me he was running Tekken 8 on a 12th gen i3, so that was enough for me to switch my plans over to Intel.This 14th gen is incrementally faster than the previous generations but cost about the same.So far no problems, seems like a good chip."
